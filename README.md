## mosquitto mqtt broker (multiarch - docker manifest & binfmt)
You can use this image as a container and as well as a service in a swarm.
For swarm usage, itÂ´s recommended to use a distributed filesystem like glusterfs and map "local" directories to the service.

  * If you want to use mosquitto with passwords, generate a password file with mosquitto_passwd first and enable the usage of passwords afterwards.
  * For a quick start, you can use the sample configuration files provided on the docker_mosquitto github repository. Please copy them to your local config-directory and use the following flow to generate a password pair and start mqtt as a service on your swarm. A script will help you to generate a user-name / password pair.

### Supported architectures:
amd64, i386, arm32v6, arm32v7, arm64v8, ppc64el, s390x


### Usage
(multiarch image - no need to specify architecture by adding architecture specific tag)

   * pull image
   
```
docker pull holgerimbery/docker_mosquitto:latest
```
   
   * copy config files (github: directory config) to you local config - directory
   * generate username and password: start a container (please modify volume mapping according to your needs) on the master

```
docker run -it -v /mnt/glusterfs/config/mqtt/config/:/mqtt/config --entrypoint "/bin/bash" holgerimbery/docker_mosquitto:latest
```

   * start password setup process
   
```
cd /mqtt/config && chmod 755 mosquitto_password_install.sh && ./mosquitto_password_install.sh
```

```
bash mosquitto_password.sh
```
   * edit /mqtt/config/conf.d/ssl.conf & /mqtt/config/conf.d/websocket_ssl.conf (path to certs)

   * exit & close the container
   
```
exit
```

   * start mosquitto as a service on your swarm:

```
docker service create --name mosquitto \
--mount type=bind,source=/mnt/glusterfs/config/mqtt/data,target=/mqtt/data \
--mount type=bind,source=/mnt/glusterfs/config/mqtt/config,target=/mqtt/config \
--mount type=bind,source=/mnt/glusterfs/config/mqtt/log,target=/mqtt/log \
--network ingress \
--publish 1883:1883 \
--publish 9001:9001 \
